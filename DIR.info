DIRS that are in "branch 4.5.1", may need them (all? most?) in singularity container if build that way.


dirs that are from tar extracts
-------------------------------

* scripts
	tar xfz ~/Downloads/M3SCRIPTS.CMAQv4.5.1.tar.gz 
* models
	tar xfz ~/Downloads/M3MODELS.CMAQv4.5.1.tar.gz 
* doc
	tar xfz ~/Downloads/M3DOCS.CMAQv4.5.1.tar.gz 

dirs created manually
---------------------

* lib/
	dir in /global/home/groups-sw/pc_adjoint/Tin_Ho/CMAS4.5.1/rel
	was created manually, as noted in build.rst   thus not in source tree.

* ioapi
  contains the extracted source of ioapi, compile in there.
