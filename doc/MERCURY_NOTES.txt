                  ATMOSPHERIC MERCURY - 21 MARCH 2006


 New treatments for gaseous chemistry, aqueous chemistry and deposition 
 have been developed to simulate atmospheric mercury fate and transport. 
 The gaseous chemistry mechanism is a modification of the CB-IV mechanism 
 (Gery et. al., 1989; Gipson and Young, 1999) where four new reactions 
 involving mercury have been added.  The new mechanism has the base name 
 CB4HG_AE3_AQ. Four mercury species were added to the model:  elemental 
 mercury gas (HG), divalent gaseous mercury (HGIIGAS), I-mode aerosol 
 mercury (APHGI), and J- mode aerosol mercury (APHGJ).  At this time, only 
 the EBI solver has been applied for the gaseous chemistry mechanism 
 including mercury.
 
 Simulation of mercury also requires a treatment of aqueous chemistry with 
 a special version of the AQCHEM routine, a treatment of aerosol dynamics 
 with a special version of the AE3 option, and simulation of chlorine using 
 the capability added with CMAQ 4.5 (CMAS, 2005).

 The cloud chemistry mechanism in AQCHEM has been modified to include six 
 new chemical reactions and 14 sorption/de-sorption reactions involving 
 mercury. Some of the aqueous chemical reactions of mercury are relatively 
 fast compared to the non-mercury reactions previously in the model and the 
 iterative solution criteria used to solve the aqueous chemical system were 
 modified to maintain numerical stability and accuracy.  Solution of the 
 aqueous chemical model with mercury added requires a significant increase 
 in the number of calculations.  However, cloud chemistry was previously a 
 small fraction of the total computational requirement and the increase in 
 CPU time for the entire model calculation is normally 10 to 20% depending 
 on the fraction of finite volumes where cloud water is present.

 An earlier experimental implementation of mercury treatments in CMAQ is 
 described in Bullock and Brehme (2002).  CMAQ 4.5.1 contains updates to 
 this earlier version in a number of areas to improve the underlying 
 science and to address comments from peer review.  The updates in mercury 
 chemistry are as follows:  (1) the elemental mercury reaction with 
 hydrogen peroxide assumes the formation of 100% divalent gaseous mercury 
 rather than 100% aerosol mercury; (2) the elemental mercury reaction with 
 ozone assumes the formation of 50% divalent gaseous mercury and 50% 
 aerosol mercury rather than 100% aerosol mercury; (3) the elemental 
 mercury reaction with hydroxyl radical assumes the formation of 50% 
 divalent gaseous mercury and 50% aerosol mercury rather than 100% aerosol 
 mercury; and (4) the rate constant for the HG + OH reaction was lowered 
 slightly to 7.7 x 10**(-14) cm**(3) molecules**(-1) s**(-1) based on the 
 lower range of the kinetic rate constant estimated by Pal and Ariya 
 (2004).  Dry deposition of elemental mercury gas was also added, with 
 deposition velocity values provided from MCIP using a heuristic approach 
 involving estimates of surface reactivity, stomatal resistance, and 
 mesophyll resistance factors, and accepted values for the molecular 
 diffusivity of atomic mercury.  It should be noted that this dry 
 deposition of elemental mercury can lead to unrealistic depletion of that 
 species if natural mercury emissions and re-emission of anthropogenic 
 mercury are not also accounted for.  CMAQ 4.5.1 mercury model development 
 was conducted using biogenic mercury emission information derived from a 
 special version of the Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (BEIS) 
 described in Lin et al. (2005).  

 NOTE:  CURRENTLY, THE CMAQ MERCURY MODEL ONLY OPERATES WITH THE
        "aero3" (AE3) MODULE.  WE PLAN TO EXTEND THE MERCURY MODEL
        TO INCLUDE THE "aero4" (AE4) MODULE IN THE NEXT RELEASE.
 
 To run the mercury version of CMAQ, you will need to generate emissions 
 files using SMOKE with the correct ancillary files (see Appendix A below 
 for a description of the mercury emissions processing).  Initial and 
 boundary condition files should be produced by the ICON and BCON 
 processors with the same mechanism as the CCTM.  We have outlined below 
 the procedure for building and running ICON and BCON using a modified set 
 of "profile" data.

 ICON:
 
   You will need to compile ICON to use the "cb4hg_ae3_aq" mechanism.  The 
   following is a "patch" style difference in the bldit.icon.pgf script:

      42c42
      <  set APPL  = e1a
      ---
      >  set APPL  = h1a
      64,65c64
      <  set ModMech   = ( module radm2_to_cb4      $Revision; )
      < #set ModMech   = ( module radm2_to_saprc99  $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModMech   = ( module radm2_to_cb4hg    $Revision; )
      70,73c69
      < #set Mechanism = cb4_ae3_aq
      <  set Mechanism = cb4_ae4_aq
      < #set Mechanism = saprc99_ae3_aq
      < #set Mechanism = saprc99_ae4_aq
      ---
      >  set Mechanism = cb4hg_ae3_aq


   Likewise you will need to modify run.icon to access the appropriate 
   profile data.  The following is a "patch" style difference in run.icon:

      7c7
      < # Usage: run.icon >&! icon_e2a.log &                                  #
      ---
      > # Usage: run.icon >&! icon_h2a.log &                                  #
      22,23c22,23
      <  set APPL     = cb4
      <  set CFG      = e1a
      ---
      >  set APPL     = cb4hg
      >  set CFG      = h1a
      80c80
      <     setenv IC_PROFILE      $M3DATA/raw/icon/ic_profile_v7.dat
      ---
      >     setenv IC_PROFILE      $M3DATA/raw/icon/ic_profile_v7h.dat
      

 BCON:

   You will also need to compile BCON to use the "cb4hg_ae3_aq" mechanism. 
   The following is a "patch" style difference in the bldit.bcon.pgf 
   script:

      42c42
      <  set APPL  = e1a
      ---
      >  set APPL  = h1a
      62,63c62
      <  set ModMech   = ( module radm2_to_cb4      $Revision; )
      < #set ModMech   = ( module radm2_to_saprc99  $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModMech   = ( module radm2_to_cb4hg    $Revision; )
      68,71c67
      < #set Mechanism = cb4_ae3_aq
      <  set Mechanism = cb4_ae4_aq
      < #set Mechanism = saprc99_ae3_aq
      < #set Mechanism = saprc99_ae4_aq
      ---
      >  set Mechanism = cb4hg_ae3_aq


   You will need to modify run.bcon to use the appropriate profile data. 
   The following is a "patch" style difference in run.bcon:

      7c7
      < # Usage: run.bcon >&! bcon_e2a.log &                                  #
      ---
      > # Usage: run.bcon >&! bcon_h1a.log &                                  #
      22,23c22,23
      <  set APPL     = cb4
      <  set CFG      = e1a
      ---
      >  set APPL     = cb4hg
      >  set CFG      = h1a
      83c83
      <     setenv BC_PROFILE      $M3DATA/raw/bcon/bc_profile_v7.dat
      ---
      >     setenv BC_PROFILE      $M3DATA/raw/bcon/bc_profile_v7h.dat

 CCTM:

   In order to build the mercury version of the CCTM executable program, 
   several modules and a different chemical mechanism must be specified in 
   the model build script.  You can modify the bldit.cctm.linux script as 
   follows and build the mercury version of the CCTM:

      43c43
      <  set APPL  = e2a
      ---
      >  set APPL  = h2a
      94,95c94
      <  set ModVdiff  = ( module eddy               $Revision; )
      < #set ModVdiff  = ( module acm                $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModVdiff  = ( module eddy_hg            $Revision; )
      106,107c105
      <  set ModChem   = ( module ebi_cb4            $Revision; )
      < #set ModChem   = ( module ebi_saprc99        $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModChem   = ( module ebi_cb4hg          $Revision; )
      110,111c108
      < #set ModAero   = ( module aero3              $Revision; )
      <  set ModAero   = ( module aero4              $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModAero   = ( module aero3_hg           $Revision; )
      114c111
      <  set ModAdepv  = ( module aero_depv2         $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModAdepv  = ( module aero_depv2_hg      $Revision; )
      117,118c114
      < #set ModCloud  = ( module cloud_radm         $Revision; )
      <  set ModCloud  = ( module cloud_acm          $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModCloud  = ( module cloud_acm_hg       $Revision; )
      128,131c124
      < #set Mechanism = cb4_ae3_aq
      <  set Mechanism = cb4_ae4_aq
      < #set Mechanism = saprc99_ae3_aq
      < #set Mechanism = saprc99_ae4_aq
      ---
      >  set Mechanism = cb4hg_ae3_aq


 Next, modify the run script as follows (you will need to generate your own 
 emissions files):

      7c7
      < # Usage: run.cctm >&! cctm_e2a.log &                                  #
      ---
      > # Usage: run.cctm >&! cctm_h2a.log &                                  #
      22,23c22,23
      <  set APPL     = e2a
      <  set CFG      = e2a
      ---
      >  set APPL     = h2a
      >  set CFG      = h2a
      105,109c105,109
      <  set EMISpath  = $M3DATA/emis/tut02
      <  set EMISfile  = e_32km_cb4.19990702.ncf
      < #set EMISfile  = e_32km_cb4.19990703.ncf
      < #set EMISfile  = e_08km_cb4.19990702.ncf
      < #set EMISfile  = e_08km_cb4.19990703.ncf
      ---
      >  set EMISpath  = $M3DATA/emis/tut02hg
      >  set EMISfile  = e_32km_cb4ae3hg.19990702.ncf
      > #set EMISfile  = e_32km_cb4ae3hg.19990703.ncf
      > #set EMISfile  = e_08km_cb4ae3hg.19990702.ncf
      > #set EMISfile  = e_08km_cb4ae3hg.19990703.ncf
      117c117
      <  set GC_ICfile = ICON_cb4_M_32_99TUT02_profile
      ---
      >  set GC_ICfile = ICON_cb4hg_M_32_99TUT02_profile
      120c120
      <  set GC_BCfile = BCON_cb4_M_32_99TUT02_profile
      ---
      >  set GC_BCfile = BCON_cb4hg_M_32_99TUT02_profile


 Note:  You can change the default scripts by using the Unix "patch" 
        utility. Cut the indented section listed above into a file, say 
        "mod." Then type, for example, "patch run.cctm mod."

                Emissions Used as Input to CMAQv4.5.1

 Ancillary Files Used with SMOKE for Processing the Mercury Inventories

 During emissions modeling, the ancillary data are combined with the 
 emissions inventory data to convert the inventories into the gridded, 
 hourly resolution, and chemical species needed by CMAQ to simulate 
 mercury.  The ancillary files that are different from the ones used for 
 non-mercury modeling are:  (1) the inventory table, which is used to read 
 in the pollutant codes from the NEI and convert to SMOKE inventory 
 pollutants, (2) the chemical speciation data used to convert the raw 
 mercury emissions into the species needed by the CMAQ model.

 (1) Ancillary file for reading in the NEI Inventory

 We developed the SMOKE input file called the “inventory table” to read in 
 the various species of mercury reported in the 1999 NEI and convert them 
 to either the model species needed by CMAQ or to an unspeciated mercury 
 placeholder called “HGSUM” that was speciated through the SMOKE Spcmat 
 program using speciation profiles. The fields shown in the table below 
 provide the same information as was included in the inventory table. The 
 “adjustment factor” in this table allows SMOKE to adjust the mass of those 
 inventory compounds containing elements in addition to mercury, to account 
 for only the mercury portion of the compound.

 (2) Ancillary Files for Chemical speciation

 The mercury speciation factors are used by SMOKE to convert any 
 unspeciated mercury (i.e., HGSUM mentioned above) into the CMAQ model 
 species: particulate divalent mercury (PHGI), gaseous divalent mercury 
 (HGIIGAS) and elemental mercury (HG).  Speciation profiles were assigned 
 to the inventory sources using MACT codes and SCC codes.  We 
 preferentially used MACT-based profile assignments over SCC-based profile 
 assignments.  The global default speciation profile (applied for records 
 that neither matched to MACT or SCC-based profiles) use 20% PHGI, 30% 
 HGIIGAS, and 50% HG. In addition, we corrected the speciation profile data 
 file provided with SMOKE version 2.1 to use a molecular weight of 200.59 
 for HGIIGAS. The profile data used for MACT and SCC codes are those shown 
 in Appendix B of the Clean Air Mercury Rule Techical Support Document for 
 Emissions (CAMR, 2005).
