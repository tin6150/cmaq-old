                 RELEASE_NOTES for CMAQv4.5.1 - 17 Mar 2006


The changes and new features of this release are:

1)  Mercury
        - Added mercury modeling capability (see MERCURY_NOTES)

2)  Chemistry
        - Beta-version of CB05 (see CB05_NOTES)
        - Updates to the SAPRC99/air toxics chemistry and associated EBI solver

3)  Aerosols
        - Recomputed tabulated binary activity coefficients in ISORROPIA

4)  PBL modeling
        - Eliminate surrogate JACOBF, since now in mcip output
        - Code change to accomodate more ways to specify mol/s for emissions
          units, assumes mass units no longer used
        - Cap the application of the kzmin algorithm at 500 m above surface

5)  Clouds
        - Floor-value set for Aitken-mode mass in getalpha.f to avoid
          possible NANs
        Aqueous Chemistry:
        - Integration timestep calculation bug fix
        - Discontinued aerosol species lumping:  separate elemental carbon
          from primary aerosol; split organic aerosols into primary,
          secondary biogenic, and secondary anthropogenic
        - The AE_A2AQ.EXT file for all chemical mechanisms was updated to
          reflect the new species treatment in the cloud model
        - Fixed 3rd moment calc to include EC and primary organics (not
          secondary)
        - Re-arranged logic for setting Cl & Na ending conc
        - Added pointers/indirect addressing for arrays WETDEP and LIQUID

6)  Advection
        - Bug fixes: Fortran 90 code interface for ASTEP and CFL number check

7)  Parallel I/O library
        - More robust allocation error checking and ensuring that I/O processor
          can't access non-existing memory
        - Add worker and I/O processors partition scheme

8)  Process Analysis
        PROCAN
        - Add correct methods to access mass-conserving advection process
        - Changed the names of some of the operators to be 4 chars in length
          to help insure unique compound variable names
        - Change NPROCS in PA_CMN.EXT to NPRCS to avoid name conflict with 
          CCTM multiprocessing variable
        - Bug fixes: gas species family flag array index, N_IPR_SPC value for
          no integrated process rates option, remove blank character in
          'Air density' species name
        CCTM
        - Fix erroneous operation in parallel CCTM for Process Analysis
          subdomains that are windowed from model domain
        - Move code dealing with process analysis from Frotran 90 module
          HGRD_DEFN to module PAGRD_DEFN and modify PAGRD_DEFN to handle
          subdomains that are windowed from model domain
          
9) Other
        - Move barrier in wr_aconc.F to avoid race condition (Michael Bane's
          suggestion)
