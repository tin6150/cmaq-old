==========================================================================+ 
 CVS-1.11 Release---------------------------------------------------------+
==========================================================================+ 

 Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is a software configuration management 
 tool that controls the concurrent editing of sources by several users 
 working on releases built from a hierarchical set of directories.

 For an overview of CVS, see the Web page at:
    http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/

 This page leads to source code download links and binary distributions for 
 some Unix platforms:

    http://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/cvs/

 A wealth of documentation can be found at:

    http://www.cvshome.org/docs/

 Instructions for installing the CVS package

 1) cd to the location where you want to unpack the software.

 2) Download file cvs-1.11.tar.gz from the distribution WEB site

 3) Uncompress and extract the files using gunzip and tar commands. - enter 
    "tar -xvfz  cvs-1.11.tar.gz" to uncompress and extract files These 
    steps should create a cvs-1.11 directory that contains files used to 
    create the CVS package via make.

 3) cd to directory cvs-1.11 and read the README and INSTALL files. In the 
    INSTALL file there are more detailed instructions and suggestions on 
    configure options and environmental variables needed for various 
    systems that you may need to set before running the configure script.

 4) We found that we needed to set the following environment variable:
    setenv CC 'gcc' (for the C compiler)

 5) Run the "configure" script with the option shown:
       -  enter "./configure --prefix=target_directory

    ("--prefix=" defines the target location where CVS will be installed.)

 6) Run the "make" program.  This compiles the source files.

 7) Run the "make install" program.  This installs the CVS package in four
    subdirectories (bin, lib, info, and man) in your target directory.

 Instructions for building netCDF-3.6.0-p1 for LINUX----------------------+
==========================================================================+ 

 1) download the netcdf compressed tar file (netcdf.tar.gz) from
    the ftp site (ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf)

 2) uncompress and extract files

        tar xvfz netcdf.tar.gz

 3) go to the netcdf-3.6.0-p1/src directory and read INSTALL file

 4) set enviroment variables for your system

       setenv FC pgf90
       setenv CC gcc
       setenv FFLAGS "-O2"
       setenv CPPFLAGS "-DNDEBUG -DpgiFortran -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE"

 5) execute the configure script

    Decide on where you want to install this package.  This will be used as 
    the --prefix= argument to the configure script below.  The default 
    installation prefix is "..", which will install the package's files in 
    ../bin, ../lib, ../man, etc. -- relative to the top-level source 
    directory.

    ./configure [--prefix=_whatever_you_decided]

    The square brackets above merely indicate that the "prefix" 
    specification is optional: do not type them.

 6) run make to compile and link

       make

 7) run make to test

       make test

 8) run make to install

       make install

    These steps should create directories /bin, /include, /lib, and /man in 
    the location specified with the prefix argument or in the parent 
    directory as default (see step 5).
