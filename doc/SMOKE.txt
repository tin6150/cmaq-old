                Information about SMOKE - 14 Sep 2005


 The Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emission (SMOKE) model was developed by 
 the Environmental Modeling Center at MCNC under cooperative research 
 agreements and contracts with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
 (EPA).  Development of SMOKE continues at UNC-CEP and is partially 
 supported by CMAS.

 The emissions data for the tutorial of this release of CMAQ were prepared 
 with SMOKE.

 SMOKE code is open source Fortran90 code, and is consistent with the 
 netCDF I/O API convention used by CMAQ.

 Emission inventory data are accepted by SMOKE in the Inventory Data 
 Analyzer (IDA) format (described in the SMOKE documentation).  Speciation 
 for selected gas phase lumped species mechanisms is included.  Currently, 
 lumping to accommodate the CB4, RADM2, SAPRC99 lumped species mechanisms 
 is accomplished by SMOKE.  SMOKE also speciates fine particulate emissions 
 (PM 2.5) to six particulate categories to support the aerosol chemistry 
 portions of CMAQ. Hourly biogenic and on-road mobile emission data are 
 modeled directly using BEIS 3.12 and Mobile 6, respectively, which are 
 embedded in SMOKE.

 The most recently released version of SMOKE (version 2.1) may be 
 downloaded from the CMAS web site at

 A user manual, including file formats, a separate test case (not the 
 tutorial with this CMAQ release), and other relevant links are available 
 on the SMOKE page.  Click on "Download SMOKE" to access the SMOKE code and 
 specific installation instructions for your system. Additional inventory 
 documentation and SMOKE datasets developed for the Clean Air Interstate 
 Rule (CAIR) are available at
