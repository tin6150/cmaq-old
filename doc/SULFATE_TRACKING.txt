                     SULFATE_TRACKING - 15 Sep 2005


 CMAQv4.5 includes an optional diagnostic model configuration that provides 
 detailed information on the modeled sulfur budget.  This model version, 
 referred to as the CMAQ Sulfate Tracking Model, tracks sulfate production 
 from the gas-phase and the five aqueous-phase chemical reactions, as well 
 as contributions from direct emissions and initial and boundary 
 conditions.  Each of the tracked species is advected, diffused, processed 
 through clouds, and deposited (both wet and dry) individually.  The CMAQ 
 sulfate tracking model is a valuable tool in examining the nonlinearities 
 in the production of sulfate.
 
 NOTE:  CURRENTLY, THE SULFATE TRACKING MODEL ONLY OPERATES WITH THE
        "aero3" (AE3) AND "cloud_radm" MODULES.  WE PLAN TO EXTEND THE
        SULFATE TRACKING CAPABILITY TO INCLUDE THE "aero4" (AE4) AND
        "cloud_acm" MODULES IN THE NEXT RELEASE.
 
 In order to build the sulfate tracking version of the CTM executable 
 program, several modules and a different chemical mechanism must be 
 specified in the model build script.  You can modify the bldit.cctm.linux 
 script as follows and build the sulfate tracking version of the CCTM:
 
      40c40
      <  set APPL  = e2a
      ---
      >  set APPL  = se2a
      91c91
      <  set ModVdiff  = ( module eddy               $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModVdiff  = ( module eddy_sulf          $Revision; )
      106,107c106,107
      < #set ModAero   = ( module aero3              $Revision; )
      <  set ModAero   = ( module aero4              $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModAero   = ( module aero3_sulf         $Revision; )
      > #set ModAero   = ( module aero4              $Revision; )
      110c110
      <  set ModAdepv  = ( module aero_depv2         $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModAdepv  = ( module aero_depv2_sulf    $Revision; )
      113,114c113,114
      < #set ModCloud  = ( module cloud_radm         $Revision; )
      <  set ModCloud  = ( module cloud_acm          $Revision; )
      ---
      >  set ModCloud  = ( module cloud_radm_sulf    $Revision; )
      > #set ModCloud  = ( module cloud_acm          $Revision; )
      124c124
      <  set Mechanism = cb4_ae4_aq
      ---
      >  set Mechanism = cb4_ae3st_aq

 Then modify the run.cctm script as follows:

      19,20c19,20
      <  set APPL     = e2a
      <  set CFG      = e2a
      ---
      >  set APPL     = se2a
      >  set CFG      = se2a

 Note: You can change the default script by using the Unix "patch" 
       utility. Cut the indented section listed above into a file, say 
       "mod." Then type "patch run.cctm mod."

 The sulfate tracking model will work with the existing IC file, BC file, 
 and emissions files available for use with the standard CMAQ model.  No 
 additional processing is required to prepare input data for this model 
 version.

 The output concentration & deposition files will include additional 
 species beyond the normal species list.  These new output species are 
 listed in Table 1 below.
