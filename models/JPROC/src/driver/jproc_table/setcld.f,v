C*********************************************************************
C
C   CLOUD MUST BE SPECIFIED EVEN FOR CLEAR PHOTOLYSIS RATES
C   A FINE GRID IS REQUIRED BY THE DELTA-EDDINGTON SOLVER
C   DEPTH = cloud optical depth
C   IBASE = cloud base index (height/km  +  1)
C   ITOP =  cloud top index (height/km  +  1)
C           NSUBKM = cloud sublayers/km
C           NSBTOT = total number of cloud sublayers (36 or less)
C           NLAYS = total number of atmospheric layers
C   CLOUD(K) = cloud optical depth profile.  Relative optical depth
C           cloud sublayer.  Assume constant cloud profile for now
C           Re- normalize to total optical depth
C           OMCLD = single scattering cross sect.  Use 0.9995
C           GCLD = asymetry factor.  Use 0.875
