      SUBROUTINE SETAIR ( NWL, MIDWL, HAIR, OMRAY, GRAY, ARAYL )

C*********************************************************************
C
C  Specify air/Rayleigh parameters
C    HAIR      = air scale height, used to estimate ozone density
C                   column a upper boundary (50km).
C    OMRAY     = single scattering albedo, Rayleigh.  Use 1.00
C    GRAY      =  asymetry factor for Rayleigh scattering.  Use 0.0
C    ARAYL(KL) = Rayleigh scattering cross section, from
C                Frohlich and Shaw, Appl.Opt. v.11, p.1773 (1980).
C                overrides tabulation of JDATA.BASE
