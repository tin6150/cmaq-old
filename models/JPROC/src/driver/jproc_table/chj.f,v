      FUNCTION CHJ ( ZETA )
      
C**********************************************************************
C
C  Chapman function is used when the solar zenith angle exceeds
C     75 deg., this is the updated RADM2 version (VERSION 89137)
C     interpolates between values given in, e.g., McCartney (1976).
C
C  Edit history:
C
C     04/08/96 - Moved mods from Sasha's new code to this routine
C     01/03/95 - Function has been completely rewritten for  -SF-
C                readability and efficiency
