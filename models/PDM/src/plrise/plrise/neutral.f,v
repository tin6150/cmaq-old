      SUBROUTINE NEUTRAL( HS, BFLUX, UPR, USTAR, DH, IQ )
C**********************************************************************

C FUNCTION: Computes plume rise under neutral conditions

C IN --
C    HS      R        Stack Height
C    BFLUX   R        Buoyancy Flux
C    UPR     R        Interpolated Wind Speed
C    USTAR   R        USTAR at stack location

C OUT --
C    DH      R        Plume Rise Height (m)
C    IQ      I        Flag that neutral equation used

C Local Variables --
C    ARG1    R
C    ARG2    R
C    ARGA    R
C    ARGB    R
C    ARGC    R

C ROUTINES called : None

      IMPLICIT NONE
                 
C DECLARE VARIABLES

      REAL    ARG1, ARG2, ARGA, ARGB, ARGC, BFLUX, DH, HS, UPR, USTAR 
      INTEGER IQ
      REAL, PARAMETER :: WSMIN  = 1.0E-01      ! Min wind speed, to avoid divide by zero
      REAL, PARAMETER :: USTAR0 = 1.0E-02      ! Min U*, to avoid divide by zero
C---- Compute neutral plume rise
      UPR = MAX( UPR, WSMIN )
      USTAR = MAX( USTAR, USTAR0 )
      ARG1 = BFLUX / ( UPR * USTAR * USTAR )
      ARG2 = HS + 1.3 * ARG1
C---- Replace to prevent numerical overflow
      ARGA = ARG1 ** 0.2
      ARGB = ARG2 ** 0.2
      ARGC = ARGA * ARGA * ARGA * ARGB * ARGB

C---- Limit DH (plume rise)  by 5*HS FOR MEPSE (stack height) 
!jmg  (DH <= 5hs)
!jmg  DH= MIN( 10.0 * HS, 1.2 * ARG3 **0.2 )

!     DH = MIN( 5.0 * HS, 1.2 * ARGC )
      DH = MIN(10.0 * HS, 1.2 * ARGC )   ! Use 10 to compare to plmris
      IQ = 2

      RETURN
      END
