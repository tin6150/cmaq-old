      SUBROUTINE RESBF1( DH, DHT, ZT, IQ, U, HS, USTAR, S, RBFLUX)
C**********************************************************************
 
C FUNCTION:  Calculate residual BOUYANCY at the height ZT above the stack.

C CALLED BY PLUMER

C        ARGUMENT LIST:
C INPUTS --
C        DH      R        HEIGHT OF PLUME RISE ABOVE STACK (M)
C        ZT      R        HEIGHT OF THE TOP OF THIS LAYER ABOVE
C                             STACK TOP (M)
C        IQ      I        PLUME RISE EQUATION USED ( 1-3 )
C        HSTAR   R        CONVECTIVE SCALING PARAMETER (M**2/S**3)
C        U       R        WIND SPEED (M/S)
C        HS      R        PHYSICAL STACK HEIGHT (M)
C        USTAR   R        FRICTION VELOCITY (M/S)
C        S       R        STABILITY PARAMETER (S**-2)
C        BFLUX   R        BUOYANCY FLUX at stack top  (M**4/S**3)

C OUTPUT --
C        RBFLUX  R        RESIDUAL BUOYANCY FLUX AT THE TOP OF THIS
C                             LAYER (M**4/S**3)

C ROUTINES CALLED --
C        NONE

      IMPLICIT NONE

      REAL DHT, DH, HS, R, RBFLUX, S, U, USTAR, ZT, H, C
      INTEGER IQ

      RBFLUX = 0.0
      R = DHT - ZT

      IF ( R .LT. 0.0 .OR. HS .LT. 0.0 ) GO TO 999

C---- According to IQ, which indicates which plume rise formulation was taken,
C     calc. residual buoyancy
C     Plume top (DHT which 1.5 DH) used in eqns to determine residual bouyancy.
C     Factor 1.5 used to compute C for unstable, 1.5 already built in to others.
      IF ( IQ .EQ. 1 ) THEN
         C = 1.5 * 30.0
         RBFLUX = U * ( ( DHT - ZT ) / C ) ** 1.6667
      ELSE IF ( IQ .EQ. 2 ) THEN
         H = HS + 0.6667 * DHT
         RBFLUX = ( R ** 1.6667 ) * U * USTAR * USTAR / ( 2.664 * H ** 0.6667 )
      ELSE IF ( IQ .EQ. 3 ) THEN
         RBFLUX = ( R ** 3.0 ) * U * S / 59.319
      END IF

C  Residual bouyancy flux is positive or zero.     
      RBFLUX = MAX( 0.0, RBFLUX )

999   CONTINUE

      RETURN
      END
