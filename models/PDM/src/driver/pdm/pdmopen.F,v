C   Portions of Models-3/CMAQ software were developed or based on      *
C   information from various groups: Federal Government employees,     *

C   so.  EPA therefore grants similar permissions for use of the       *

C   of derivative works to the Government without restrictions as to   *
C   use by others.  Users are responsible for acquiring their own      *
