C***********************************************************************
C   Portions of Models-3/CMAQ software were developed or based on      *
C   information from various groups: Federal Government employees,     *
C   contractors working on a United States Government contract, and    *
C   non-Federal sources (including research institutions).  These      *
C   research institutions have given the Government permission to      *
C   use, prepare derivative works, and distribute copies of their      *
C   work in Models-3/CMAQ to the public and to permit others to do     *
C   so.  EPA therefore grants similar permissions for use of the       *
C   Models-3/CMAQ software, but users are requested to provide copies  *
C   of derivative works to the Government without restrictions as to   *
C   use by others.  Users are responsible for acquiring their own      *
C   copies of commercial software associated with Models-3/CMAQ and    *
C   for complying with vendor requirements.  Software copyrights by    *
C   the MCNC Environmental Modeling Center are used with their         *
C   permissions subject to the above restrictions.                     *

C......................................................................
C  INCLUDE FILE: RADM_SIGMA.EXT
C
C  CONTAINS: Vertical coordinate descriptions for RADM concentration
C            files.  The user must insure that the data in this file
C            correspond to the grid and domain data used in the original
C            simulation.  Thus, this file may need modifications for 
C            any particular application.  A Hydrostatic sigma-p
C            coordinate system is assumed for the RADM model.
C
C  DEPENDENT UPON: RADM coordinates and grid domain.
