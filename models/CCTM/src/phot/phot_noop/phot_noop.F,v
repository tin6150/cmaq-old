      SUBROUTINE PHOT ( MDATE, MTIME, JDATE, JTIME, NDARK, RJ )

C**********************************************************************

C FUNCTION: 
C    PHOT, adapted from RADM, calculates the photolysis rate constants
C    to be used by the chemical solver.
C    It uses linear interpolation in time of day, height, and latitude
C    from file tabular values and optionally adjusts photolysis rates 
C    above, below and in cumulus clouds.

C PRECONDITIONS: None

C KEY SUBROUTINES/FUNCTIONS CALLED: None

C REVISION HISTORY: 
C    prototype(adaptation from RADM), Rohit Mathur, April 1993.  
C    major mods, Jeff Young, May 1994 - annotated and/or "c" in col 1
C   30 Mar 01 J.Young: Use HGRD_DEFN
C   12 Feb 05 J.Young: vertical dyn alloc - Use VGRD_DEFN
