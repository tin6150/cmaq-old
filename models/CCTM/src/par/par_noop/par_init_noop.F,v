C   Portions of Models-3/CMAQ software were developed or based on      *

      SUBROUTINE PAR_INIT( CALLER, NSPCS, CLOCK, IERROR )
C.....................................................................
C
C  PURPOSE:    No-operation version of parallel initialization, for
C              running in serial configuration. Local processor
C              dimensions are set to the one-processor values.
C              
C
C  REVISION HISTORY: 
C       Original version 10/1998 by Al Bourgeois for merging parallel
C                and serial codes.
C       Modified 01/1998 by Al Bourgeois to fix subscripts in arrays 
C                ROWSX_PE and COLSX_PE. 
C       Modified 11/2001 by Jeff Young for dynamic alloc version
C       Modified 31/01/05 J.Young: dyn alloc - establish both horizontal &
C                vertical domain specifications in one module
C                16 Jan 06 J.Young: possible PA grid init
C
C
C  ARGUMENT LIST DESCRIPTION:
C  IN:
C     CHARACTER*16 CALLER       ! Calling program name.
C     INTEGER NSPCS             ! Number of species in CGRID.
C
C  OUT:
C     REAL    CLOCK             ! Wall-clock time (sec) at MPI initialization.
C     INTEGER IERROR            ! Error code.
C
C
C  LOCAL VARIABLE DESCRIPTION:  see below
C
C  CALLS:  None 
C
C........................................................................

      USE GRID_CONF             ! horizontal & vertical domain specifications

      IMPLICIT  NONE

C Include Files

      INCLUDE SUBST_IODECL      ! I/O definitions and declarations
      INCLUDE SUBST_PACTL_ID    ! PA control parameters

C Arguments

      CHARACTER( * ), INTENT( IN ) :: CALLER ! Calling program name (not used)
      INTEGER, INTENT( IN )        :: NSPCS  ! Number of species in CGRID
      REAL, INTENT( OUT ) :: CLOCK ! Wall-clock time (sec) at MPI initialization
      INTEGER, INTENT( OUT )       :: IERROR ! Error code

C Local Variables

      INTEGER NPROCS

         END IF

C Set up horizontal domain and calculate processor-to-subdomain maps for
C process analysis, if required

      IF ( LIPR .OR. LIRR ) THEN
