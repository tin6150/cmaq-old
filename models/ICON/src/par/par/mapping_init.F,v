C decomposition in each processor

C Revision history:
C
C   Orginal version: 02/15/00 by David Wong, LM
C
C   7/20/00 David Wong, LM
C           -- convert XCELL_C, YCELL_C, XCELL_F, and YCELL_F into integer
C              before computing the ratio. This will avoid machine precision
C              problem to compute the ratio first and let the machine to
C              convert the answer into integer.
C   2/20/02 David Wong, LM
C           -- modified the ROW_DISP and COL_DISP calculations for the cases 
C              when the corresponding *_RATIO is 1 which means resolutions are 
C              the same in the fine and coarse grid.
C           -- modified the arithmetic when accessing the 2nd index of COLSX_PE 
C              and ROWSX_PE since they are starting from 1 rather than from 0.
C                         
C Argument list:
C
C In:    XCELL_C -- resolution of the x-direction in the coarse domain
C        YCELL_C -- resolution of the y-direction in the coarse domain
C        XCELL_F -- resolution of the x-direction in the fine domain
C        YCELL_F -- resolution of the y-direction in the fine domain
C        ROW     -- number of steps that the fine domain (1,1) cell needs to 
C                   leave the current coarse domain grid cell in the row 
C                   direction
C        COL     -- number of steps that the fine domain (1,1) cell needs to 
C                   leave the current coarse domain grid cell in the column
C                   direction
C
C Out:   ROW_RATIO -- the ratio between number of rows in the fine domain and
C                     coarse domain
C        COL_RATIO -- the ratio between number of column in the fine domain and
C                     coarse domain
C        ROW_DISP  -- the row-wise distance between the starting point of the 
C                     fine domain in a processor and the coarse grid boundary
C                     (not the physical application boundary)
C        COL_DISP  -- the column-wise distance between the starting point of 
C                     the fine domain in a processor and the coarse grid 
C                     boundary (not the physical application boundary)
C
C InOut: ROW_LOC   -- In:  it is the row location of the (1,1) cell of fine 
C                          domain in the coarse domain
C                     Out: it is the row location of the starting cell of fine 
C                          domain in the coarse domain in a processor
C

C                          domain in the coarse domain
