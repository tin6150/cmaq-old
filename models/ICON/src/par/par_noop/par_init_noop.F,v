      SUBROUTINE PAR_INIT( CALLER, NSPCS, CLOCK, IERROR )
C.....................................................................
C
C  PURPOSE:    No-operation version of parallel initialization, for
C              running in serial configuration. Local processor
C              dimensions are set to the one-processor values.
C              
C
C  REVISION HISTORY: 
C       Original version 10/1998 by Al Bourgeois for merging parallel
C                and serial codes.
C       Modified 01/1998 by Al Bourgeois to fix subscripts in arrays 
C                ROWSX_PE and COLSX_PE. 
C       Modified 11/2001 by Jeff Young for dynamic alloc version
C                12/13/04 J.Young: vert dyn alloc - Use VGRD_DEFN
C
C  ARGUMENT LIST DESCRIPTION:
C  IN:
C     CHARACTER*16 CALLER       ! Calling program name.
C     INTEGER NSPCS             ! Number of species in CGRID.
C
C  OUT:
C     REAL    CLOCK             ! Wall-clock time (sec) at MPI initialization.
C     INTEGER IERROR            ! Error code.
C
C  LOCAL VARIABLE DESCRIPTION:  see below
C
C  CALLS:  None 
C
C........................................................................

      USE HGRD_DEFN             ! horizontal domain specifications
      USE VGRD_DEFN             ! vertical layer specifications

      IMPLICIT  NONE

C....... Arguments:

C Calling program name (not used)
      CHARACTER( * ), INTENT( IN ) :: CALLER

!     INTEGER NLAYS             ! Number of layers in entire grid.
      INTEGER NSPCS             ! Number of species in CGRID.
      REAL    CLOCK             ! Wall-clock time (sec) at MPI initialization.
      INTEGER IERROR            ! Error code.

C....... Local Variables:

      INTEGER NPROCS
      CHARACTER( 96 ) :: MSG

C.......   Set error code to zero.
      IERROR = 0

C set horizontal grid definition

      NPROCS = 1
      MYPE = 0

      IF ( .NOT. HGRD_INIT ( NPROCS, MYPE ) ) THEN
         MSG = '*** Failure defining horizontal domain'
         CALL M3WARN ( 'PAR_INIT_NOOP', 0, 0, MSG )
         IERROR = 1
         RETURN
         END IF

C define vertical layer structure

      IF ( .NOT. VGRD_INIT() ) THEN
         MSG = '*** Failure defining vertical structure'
         CALL M3WARN ( 'PAR_INIT', 0, 0, MSG )
         IERROR = 1
         RETURN
         END IF

      RETURN
      END
