C
C        The EDSS/Models-3 I/O API depends in an essential manner
C        upon the I/O API source code.  ANY CHANGES are
C        likely to result in very obscure, difficult-to-diagnose
C        bugs caused by an inconsistency between standard "libioapi.a"
C        object-libraries and whatever code is compiled with the
C        resulting modified INCLUDE-file.
C
C        By making any changes to the I/O API source code, the
C        user explicitly agrees that in the case any assistance is 
C        required of MCNC, BAMS, or of the I/O API author,
C        CARLIE J. COATS, JR. HE AND/OR HIS PROJECT OR CONTRACT
C        AGREES TO REIMBURSE MCNC AND/OR BAMS AND/OR THE I/O API
C        AUTHOR, CARLIE J. COATS, JR., AT A RATE TRIPLE THE
C        NORMAL CONTRACT RATE FOR THE SERVICES REQUIRED.
